### Hi, I'm Ricardo ðŸ‘‹

I am a lifelong learner and an electronics engineer.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently conducting research in robotics and computer vision using deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on topics related to AI. Maybe we can develop the first AGI together! ðŸ˜„
- âš¡ Fun fact: After high school, I was uncertain about which major to choose and almost went with mathematics. I still maintain a keen interest in math and study it in my free time.

You can best reach me via [email](mailto:rotvie@gmail.com). I'm always open to intriguing conversations and collaborations.
